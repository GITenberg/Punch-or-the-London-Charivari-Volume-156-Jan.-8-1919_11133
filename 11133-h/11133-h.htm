<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>The mystery of the Foreign Office official who has not gone to
Paris for the Peace Conference has been cleared up. He is the
caretaker.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The King and Queen of Roumania," says a Paris paper, "will
embark after Christmas, orthodox style, for Western Europe." It is
easy enough to start a voyage, orthodox style; the difficulty is at
the other end.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The supreme command of the German Navy, says a telegram, has
been transferred to Wilhelmshaven. This looks like carelessness on
the part of the watch at Scapa Flow.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>This year's <i>Who's Who</i> has eighty-six more pages than that
of last year. On the other hand, since the Election quite a number
of people are not Who at all.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The present rule in <i>Who's Who</i>," says <i>The Evening
News</i>, "is that the more important a man is the less space he is
content to occupy." As some of the staff of our evening Press do
not occupy any space at all in this excellent publication we leave
readers to draw their own conclusions.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The <i>Frankf&uuml;rter Zeitung</i> observes that the ex-Kaiser
has grown very silent and morose. It is supposed that he has
something or other on his mind.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Copenhagen message states that the Spartacus people have three
times attempted to murder Count REVENTLOW, who is said to regard
these attempts as being in the worst possible taste.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Once again the newspapers have been beaten. It appears that
Princess PATRICIA knew of her engagement some time before the Press
announced it to Her Royal Highness.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"We still believe," says the <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>,
"that in thought the German and the Britisher are racially akin."
All the same we should not encourage the Hun to come over here with
the idea of making a spiritual home among his alleged
relatives.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Charged with drunkenness at the Thames Police Court a man
attributed his condition to the beer habit. It is remarkable how
men will cling to any sort of excuse.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Woolwich Arsenal, we are informed, is turning out milk-cans. Can
nothing be done, asks a pacifist, to save our children from the
insidious grip of militarism?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Nottinghamshire War Committee states that rat-catchers are now
demanding four pounds a week. Diplomacy, it appears, is the only
branch of British sport that has succeeded in escaping the taint of
professionalism.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Fractious mules," says a correspondent of <i>The Daily
Mail</i>, "should not be sent to the country for sale." The playful
kind, on the other hand, that bite and kick from sheer <i>joie de
vivre</i>, are bound to have a beneficial effect on the
agricultural temperament.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Guildford allotment-holder successfully grew new potatoes for
Christmas-day dinner. All were eaten, it appears, except one, which
was kept to show to the Christmas pudding.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is no truth in the report that Mr. DANIELS, U.S. Secretary
for the Navy, has received a telegram from Mr. WILLIAM RANDOLPH
HEARST, saying, "You furnish the navy and I'll furnish the
war."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The Crystal Palace," says. Dean INGE, "is the embodiment of
spiritual emptiness." A determined attempt is to be made to find
out what the Crystal Palace thinks of Dean INGE.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Stories of an unsuccessful Candidate in the Midlands, who was
heard to admit that the voters probably preferred his opponent's
personality, must be definitely regarded as apocryphal.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Traditions in Scotland die hard. We gather that it is stili
considered unlucky for a red-headed burglar to cross a Scottish
threshold on New Year's Eve.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A man at Berne has recently confessed to a murder he committed
twenty-one years ago. This is what comes of memory-training.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is reported that TROTSKY has been ordered by his doctor to
take a complete rest. He has therefore decided not to have any more
revolutions for the present. Orders however will be executed in
rotation.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Credit where credit is due. A woman fined at Wood Green Police
Court said her name was JOLLY and she had been having a
"jollification," yet the magistrate refrained from comment.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Where was the Poet Laureate during the visit of President
Wilson?" asks a correspondent in a contemporary. We do not share
this curiosity.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Foxes are to be found within an omnibus ride of Charing Cross,"
says Mr. RICHARD KEARTON. Young omnibuses with plenty of bone and
stamina are the best for suburban meets.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Anemones, said a lecturer at the Royal Institution, will live as
long as sixty years in captivity and are very intelligent.
Nevertheless we refuse to swallow the story about their being
taught to jump through a hoop. The man who told it must have been
thinking of an Egyptian king of the same name.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The LORD-LIEUTENANT, it is stated on good authority, threatens
that if Sinn Fein prisoners destroy any more jails they will be
rigorously released.</p>

<h2>THE VERDICT OF DEMOCRACY.</h2>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The nation's memory, then, is not so short;</p>
<p class="i2">It still recalls the fields we lately bled on;</p>
<p>And when it had to choose the likeliest sort</p>
<p class="i2">For clearing up the mess of Armageddon</p>
<p class="i4">And making all things new,</p>
<p>It chose the man whose courage saw it through.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Hun-lovers, pledged to Peace (the German kind),</p>
<p class="i2">And such as sported LENIN'S sanguine token,</p>
<p>Appealed to Liberty to speak her mind,</p>
<p class="i2">And Liberty has very frankly spoken,</p>
<p class="i4">Strewing around her polls</p>
<p>The remnants of their ungummed aureoles.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>In Amerongen there is grief to-day;</p>
<p class="i2">I seem to hear the martyr of Potsdam say,</p>
<p>"Alas for SNOWDEN, gone the downward way,</p>
<p class="i2">And O my poor, my poor beloved RAMSAY;</p>
<p class="i4">I much regret the rout</p>
<p>That washed this couple absolutely out!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Dreadfully, too, the heart of TROTSKY bleeds,</p>
<p class="i2">To match the stain upon his reeking sabre,</p>
<p>Which is the blood of Russia, when he reads</p>
<p class="i2">How BARNES, the champion knight of loyal Labour,</p>
<p class="i4">Downed in the Lowland lists</p>
<p>MACLEAN, the Red Hope of the Bolshevists.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But here is jubilation in the air</p>
<p class="i2">And matter made to build the jocund rhyme on,</p>
<p>Though in our joyance some may fail to share,</p>
<p class="i2">Like Mr. RUNCIMAN or Major SIMON,</p>
<p class="i4">That hardened warrior, he</p>
<p>Who won the Military O.B.E.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Already dawns for us a golden age</p>
<p class="i2">(Lo! with the loud "All Clear!" our p&aelig;an
mingles),</p>
<p>An era when the OUTHWAITES cease to rage</p>
<p class="i2">And there is respite from the prancing PRINGLES,</p>
<p class="i4">And absence puts a curb</p>
<p>On the reluctant lips of SAMUEL (HERB.).</p>

<h2>HOW TO THROW OFF AN ARTICLE.</h2>
<p>"Do you really write?" said Sylvia, gazing at me large-eyed with
wonder. I admitted as much.</p>
<p>"And do they print it just as you write it?"</p>
<p>"Well, their hired grammarians make a few trifling alterations
to justify their existence."</p>
<p>"And do they pay you quite a lot?"</p>
<p>"Sixpence a word."</p>
<p>"Oo! How wonderful!"</p>
<p>"But not for every word," I added hastily, "only the really
funny ones."</p>
<p>"And they send it to you by cheques?"</p>
<p>"Rather. I bought a couple of pairs of socks with the last
story; even then I had something left over."</p>
<p>"And how do you write the stories?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just get an idea and go right ahead."</p>
<p>"How wonderful! Do you just sit down and write it straight
off?"</p>
<p>I just&mdash;only just&mdash;pulled myself up in time as I
remembered that Sylvia was an enthusiast of twelve whose own
efforts had already caused considerable comment in the literary
circles described round the High School. I felt this entitled her
to some claim on my veracity.</p>
<p>"Sylvia," I cried, "I shall have to make a confession. All those
stories you have been good enough to read and occasionally smile
over are the result of a cold-blooded mechanical process&mdash;and
the help of a dictionary of synonyms."</p>
<p>"Oo! How wonderful! Do show me how."</p>
<p>"Very well. Since you are going to be a literary giantess it is
well that you should be initiated into the mysteries of producing
what I shall call the illusion of spontaneity. Now take this story
here. Here on this old envelope is THE IDEA."</p>
<p>"Oo! Let me see. I can't read a word."</p>
<p>"Of course you can't; nobody could. Rough copies are divided
into classes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"No. 1. Those I can read, but nobody else can.</p>
<p>"No. 2. Those I can't read myself after two days.</p>
<p>"No. 3. Those my typist can read.</p>
<p>"This story is about a certain Brigade Major who is an
inveterate leg-puller. Some Americans are expected to be coming for
instruction. Well, before they arrive the Brigade Major has to go
up to the line, and on his way he meets a man with a very new tin
hat who asks him in a certain nasal accent we have all come to love
if he has seen anything of a party of Americans. Spotting him as a
new chum, the Brigade Major offers to show him round the line, and
proceeds to pull his leg and tells him the most preposterous
nonsense. For instance, on a shot being fired miles away he
pretends they are in frightful danger, and leads him bent double
round and round trenches in the same circle."</p>
<p>"What a shame!"</p>
<p>"Wasn't it? Well, when he gets tired he asks the American if he
thinks he has learnt anything. The American says, 'Gee, I've been
out here two years now, but I guess you've taught me a whole heap I
didn't know. I'm a Canadian tunneller, you know, and I've got to
show some Americans our work, but I guess I've had a most
interesting time with you."</p>
<p>"Ha! ha!"</p>
<p>"Well now, to put the story into its form. Here's Copy No. 1, on
this old envelope. 'Americans coming&mdash;Brigade Major sees
American looking for party&mdash;pulls his leg&mdash;pretends to
being in frightful danger&mdash;American is Canadian who has been
out two years.' See? Copy No. 2. Here we begin to till in. Describe
Brigade headquarters and previous leg-pulls of Brigade Major. Make
up details of what he tells the American&mdash;'That's a trench.
That thing you fell over is a coil of wire. This is a sunken
road&mdash;we sunk it, etc., etc.' Copy No. 3, additions and
details, little touches of local colour, revision of choice of
words, heart-rending erasions. And here, my child," I concluded,
bringing out the beautiful, clean, smooth typed copy&mdash;"here is
the finished work itself, light, pleasant, fluent, humorous and,
most important of all, spontaneous."</p>
<p>"Oo! But how awfully cold-blooded. I thought you smiled to
yourself all the time you wrote it."</p>
<p>"My dear girl, it takes hours. If I smiled continually all that
length of time the top of my head would come off."</p>
<p>"Isn't it wonderful? Fancy building it all up from jottings on
an old envelope! What's that piece of paper you took out of the
typed copy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing to do with the literary side of it," I said,
crumpling up the little memorandum, which said that the Editor
presented compliments and regretted that he was unable to make use
of the enclosed contribution.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Henderson ... was received with a cry of 'He is not on the
map now.'"&mdash;<i>Times</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is supposed that his supporter meant to say "not on the
mat"&mdash;in reference to an incident at the close of Mr.
HENDERSON'S Ministerial career. But many a true word is said in the
Press by inadvertence.</p>

<h2>A DEMOBILISATION DISASTER.</h2>
<p>Private Randle Janvers Binderbeck and Private John Hodge (of No.
12 Platoon) both enlisted in 1914. Previously Handle wrote
articles, mostly denunciatory. He denounced the Government of the
day, tight skirts, Christian Science, scorching on scooters, the
foreign policy of Patagonia and many other things. John, on the
other hand, had not an agile brain. He worked on a farm in some
incredibly primitive capacity, and the only thing that he denounced
was the quality of the beer at the "Waggon and Horses." It
certainly was bad.</p>
<p>In the Army Randle had no ambition except to get out of it and
to remain a private while in it. His ambition for his civil career
was tremendous. He tried to prod the placid John (his neighbour in
their hut) into an equal ambition.</p>
<p>"My poor Hodge," said Randle to John, "you must cultivate a soul
above manure. Does it satisfy you, as a man made in the image of
God, to be able to distinguish between a mangold and a swede? Think
of the glory of literature, the power of the writer to send forth
his burning words to millions and sway public opinion as the west
wind sways the pliant willow."</p>
<p>"I dunno as I'd prefer that to bird-scaring or suchlike,"
murmured John.</p>
<p>Goaded by such beast-like placidity, Randle would forget all
restraint in trying to lash John into a worthy ambition.</p>
<p>It was for talking after "Lights out" that Randle and John were
given a punishment of three days' confinement to barracks. Randle,
pouring out a devastating torrent of words in the manner of a
public orator, bitterly denounced the punishment; John, who had
merely snored (the Captain said it took two to make a
conversation), bore it with the stoicism of ignorance.</p>
<p>Randle used to dream of Peace Day. He heard Sir DOUGLAS HAIG
order his Chief-of-Staff to summon Private Randle Janvers
Binderbeck. "Release him at once," said HAIG, in Randle's dream,
"to resume his colossal mission as leader and director of public
opinion."</p>
<p>If John dreamed, it was of messy farmyards and draughty fields;
but it is improbable that he dreamed at all.</p>
<p>They both went to the War and faced the Hun. Randle thought of
the Hun only as a possible wrecker of his career, therefore as a
foe of mankind. John hardly thought of the Hun except in the course
of coming into contact with him, and then he used his bayonet with
careless zeal.</p>
<p>Randle steeled himself against the rough edges of soldiering. He
allowed neither the curses of corporals nor the familiarities of
second-lieutenants to affect his dreams of the future. Always, even
<i>sotto voce</i> in the last five minutes before going over the
top, he kept before John his vision splendid.</p>
<p>It was thoir luck to remain together and unhurt. Then arrived
the great day when the Hun confessed defeat. Randle vainly awaited
a sign from the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>There came, however, a moment when No. 12 Platoon was paraded at
the Company Orderly-room. Particulars were to be taken before
filling up demobilisation forms. Men were to be grouped, on paper,
according to the nation's demand for their return to civil
life.</p>
<p>Randle Janvers Binderbeck knew this was <i>der Tag</i>.
Magnanimously he overlooked the delay and felt that HAIG might,
after all, have an excuse. John Hodge remained placid. He had long
ago classed Randle's goadings with heavies and machine-guns, as
unavoidable incidents of warfare.</p>
<p>Randle and John were called into the orderly-room together. By
an obvious error John was first summoned to the table.</p>
<p>"Well, Hodge," said the Company <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> Sergeant-Major, "what's
your job in civil life?"</p>
<p>"I dunno as I got any special job," said John. "I just sort o'
helped on the farm."</p>
<p>"You must have a group," said the C.S.M. "What did you mostly do
before the War?"</p>
<p>"S' far as that do go," said John, "I were mostly a
bird-scarer."</p>
<p>"'Bird-scarer,'" said the C.S.M. "I know there's a heading for
that somewhere. Agricultural, ain't it? 'Bird-scarer.' Ah, here we
are. 'Group 1.' You'll be one of the first for release."</p>
<p>The Company Clerk noted the fact, and the C.S.M. called "Next
man."</p>
<p>Randle Janvers Binderbeck stepped forward.</p>
<p>"What's your job, Binderbeck?" said the C.S.M.</p>
<p>(To ask Lord NORTHCLIFFE, "Do you sell newspapers'\?" To ask
BOSWELL, "Have you heard of a man named JOHNSON?" TO ask HENRY
VIII, "Were you ever married?")</p>
<p>The futility of the question flabbergasted Randle.</p>
<p>"Come on, man," said the C.S.M.</p>
<p>Randle made an effort. "Journalist," he said.</p>
<p>"'Journalist,'" said the C.S.M., "'Journalist.' Yes, I thought
so. 'Group 41.' You've got a long way to go, my lad. You 'd have
done better if you was a bird-scarer, like Hodge. Them's the boys
the nation wants&mdash;Group 1 boys. You sticks in the Army for
another six months' fatigue. Next man."</p>
<p>That was all.</p>
<p>John Hodge is now soberly awaiting demobilisation, and will not
have to wait long.</p>
<p>Randle Janvers Binderbeck is secretly consoling himself by
writing the most denunciatory articles. They will never be
published, but they afford an alternative to cocaine.</p>
<p>He feels that he can never again consent to sway public opinion
as the west wind, etc., in the interests of a nation which rates
him forty groups lower than an animated scarecrow.</p>
<p>It is the nation's own fault, Randle is blameless.</p>
<hr />
<h3>A Noisy Salute.</h3>
<p>From a review of <i>The Remembered Kiss</i>, in <i>The
Westminster Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It would be doing Miss Ayres an injustice to suppose
that there is only one kiss to remember in the whole of her novel,
but the one which gives its title is bestowed by a young and
handsome burglar, and received by a girl who mistook the noise he
was making for a thunders torm."</blockquote>
<p>As TENNYSON says in <i>The Day-Dream</i>: "O love, thy kiss
would wake the dead!"</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>Our Mr. MacTavish is a man with a past. He is now a cavalry
subaltern and he was once a sailor. As a soldier at sea is never
anything but an object of derision to sailors, correspondingly the
mere idea of a sailor on horseback causes the utmost merriment
among soldiers.</p>
<p>"Sailors on horseback!"&mdash;the very words bring visions of
apoplectic mariners careering madly across sands, three to a horse,
every limb in convulsion. Why, it's one of the world's stock
jokes.</p>
<p>The pathetic part of it is that, obeying the law of opposites,
the saddle has an irresistible and fatal attraction for the poor
chaps. They take to it on every possible and impossible occasion.
You can see them playing alleged polo at Malta, riding each other
off at right angles and employing their sticks as grappling irons.
You can see them over from the Rock whooping after Spanish foxes,
bestriding their steeds anywhere but in the appointed place.</p>
<p>As every proper farmer's boy has long, long thoughts of magic
oceans, spice isles and clipper ships, so I will warrant every
normal Naval officer dreams of a little place in the grass
counties, a stableful of long-tails and immortal runs with the
Quorn and Pytchley.</p>
<p>It was thus with our Mr. MacTavish, anyhow. A stern parent and a
strong-armed crammer projected him into the Navy, and in the Navy
he remained for years bucketing about the salt seas in light and
wobbly cruisers, enforcing intricate Bait Laws off Newfoundland in
mid-winter, or playing hide-and-seek with elusive dhows on the
Equator in midsummer, but always with a vision of that little place
in his mind's eye.</p>
<p>His opportunity arrived with the demise of the stern parent and
the acquisition of a comfortable legacy. MacTavish sent in his
papers and stepped ashore for good. He discovered the haven of his
heart's desire in the neighbourhood of Melton, purchased a pig and
a cow (which turned out to be a bullock) to give the little place a
homely air, engaged a terrier for ratting and intercourse, and with
the assistance of some sympathetic dealers was assembling as
comprehensive a collection of curbs, spavins, sprung tendons,
pin-toes, herring-guts, ewe-necks, cow-hocks and capped elbows as
could be found between the Tweed and Tamar, when&mdash;Mynheer W.
HOHENZOLLERN (as he is to-day) went and done it.</p>
<p>The evening of August 4th, 1914, discovered MacTavish sitting on
the wall of his pig-sty, his happy hunting prospects shot to
smithereens, arguing the position out with the terrier. He must
attend to this war, that was clear, but need he necessarily go back
to the salt sea? Couldn't he do his bit in some other service? What
about the Cavalry? That would mean galloping about Europe on a
jolly old gee, shouting "Hurrah!" and cutlassing the
foot-passengers. A merry life, combining all the glories of
fox-hunting with only twenty-five per cent. of its
safety&mdash;according to <i>Jorrocks</i>.</p>
<p>What about the Cavalry, then? The terrier semaphored complete
approbation with its tail stump and even the pig made enthusiastic
noises.</p>
<p>A month later MacTavish turned up in a Reserve Regiment of
Cavalry at the Curragh as a "young officer." The Riding-Master
treated his case as no more hopeless than anybody else's and
MacTavish was making average progress until one evening in the
anteroom he favoured the company with a few well-spiced Naval
reminiscences.</p>
<p>Next morning the Riding-Master was convulsed with merriment at
the mere sight of him, addressed him variously as Jellicoe, Captain
Kidd and Sinbad, and, after first warning MacTavish not to imagine
he was ashore at Port Said riding the favourite in a donkey Derby,
translated all his instructions into nautical language. For
instance: "Right rein&mdash;haul the starboard yoke line;
gallop&mdash;full steam ahead; halt&mdash;cast anchor;
dismount&mdash;abandon ship," and so forth, giving his delicate and
fanciful sense of humour full play and evoking roars of laughter
from the whole house. It did not take MacTavish long to realise
that, no matter what he said, he would never again be taken
seriously in that place; he was, in fact, the world's stock joke, a
sailor on horseback (Ha, ha, ha!).</p>
<p>He set his jaw and was determined that he would not be caught
tripping again; there should be no more reminiscences. Once clear
of Ireland he would bury his past.</p>
<p>All this happened years ago.</p>
<p>When I came back from leave the other day I asked for Albert
Edward. "He and MacTavish are up at Corpse H.Q.," said the skipper;
"they're helping the A.P.M. straighten the traffic out. By the way
you 'd better trickle up there and relieve them, as they're both
going on leave in a day or so."</p>
<p>I trickled up to Corpse and eventually discovered Albert Edward
alone, practising the three-card trick with a view to a career
after the War. "You'll enjoy this Mess," said he, turning up "the
Lady" where he least expected her; "it's made up of Staff
eccentrics&mdash;Demobilizing, Delousing, Educational, Laundry and
Burial <i>wallahs</i>&mdash;all sorts, very interesting; you'll
learn how the other half lives and all that. Oh, that reminds me.
You know poor old MacTavish's secret, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Of course," said I; "everybody does. Why?"</p>
<p>Albert Edward grinned. "Because there's another bloke here with
a dark past, only this is t'other way about; he's a bumpkin turned
sailor, Blenkinsop by name, you know, the Shropshire hackney
breeders. He's Naval Division. Ever rub against those
merchants?"</p>
<p>I had not.</p>
<p>"Well, I have," Albert Edward went on. "They're wonders; pretend
they're in mid-ocean all the time, stuck in the mud on the
Beaucourt Ridge, gummed in the clay at Souchez&mdash;anywhere. They
'come aboard' a trench and call their records-office&mdash;a staid
and solid bourgeois dwelling in Havre&mdash;<i>H.M.S. Victory</i>.
If you were bleeding to death and asked for the First Aid Post they
wouldn't understand you; you've got to say 'Sick bay' or bleed on.
If you want a meal you've got to call the cook-house 'The galley,'
or starve.</p>
<p>"This <i>matelot</i> Blenkinsop has got it very badly. He
obtained all his sea experience at the Crystal Palace and has been
mud-pounding up and down France for three years, and yet here we
have him now pretending there's no such thing as dry land."</p>
<p>"Not an unnatural delusion," I remarked.</p>
<p>"Well," resumed Albert Edward, "across the table from him sits
our old MacTavish, lisping, 'What is the Atlantic? Is it a herb?'
I'll bet my soul they're in their billets at this moment, MacTavish
mugging up some stable-patter out of NAT GOULD, and Blenkinsop
imbibing a dose of ship-chatter from 'BARTIMEUS.' They'll come in
for food presently, MacTavish doing what he imagines to be a
'cavalry-roll,' tally-hoing at the top of his voice, and Blenkinsop
weaving his walk like the tough old sea-dog he isn't, ship a-hoying
and avasting for dear life."</p>
<p>"They're both going on leave with you to-morrow, aren't they?" I
asked.</p>
<p>Albert Edward nodded.</p>
<p>"Then their game is up," said I.</p>
<p>Albert Edward's brow crinkled. "I don't quite get you."</p>
<p>"My dear old fool," said I, "it's blowing great guns now. With
the leave-packet doing the unbusted broncho act for two hours on
end it shouldn't be very difficult to separate the sheep from the
goat, the true-blue sailor from the pea-green lubber, should it?
They may be able to bluff each other, but not the silvery Channel
in mid-winter."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg
23]</span>
<p>Albert Edward slapped his knee and laughed aloud.</p>
<hr />
<p>They all came back from England last night. I lost no time in
cornering Albert Edward.</p>
<p>"Well, everything worked just as I prophesied, didn't it?" said
I. "With the first buck the old boat gave Blenkinsop tottered to
the rail and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Albert Edward shook his head.</p>
<p>"No, he didn't. He ate a pound of morphia and lay in the Saloon
throughout sleeping like a little child."</p>
<p>"But MacTavish?" I stammered.</p>
<p>"Oh, MacTavish," said Albert Edward&mdash;"MacTavish took an
emetic."</p>

<h2>MUSICAL GOSSIP.</h2>
<p>We are semi-officially informed on the best authority that the
undermentioned nominations&mdash;some of which have already been
accepted&mdash;to the thrones and chairs now vacant in various
parts of the world have been made and approved by the Allied
Governments.</p>
<p>Foremost among these is the nomination "by acclamation" of
RICHARD STRAUSS as King of the Cannibal Islands. It is understood
that the illustrious composer has already arrived and that a grand
congress of Anthropophagi with suitable festivities is in
contemplation.</p>
<p>Two nominations which have been the cause of great satisfaction
in diplomatic circle are those of Mr. MARK HAMBOURG to the Kingdom
of Palestine, and that of M. MOISEIWITCH to the throne of the
Solomon Islands. Jamborees of jubilation are already rife in the
latter locality.</p>
<p>Sir HENRY WOOD has been simultaneously approached from two
quarters. The leading citizens of Sonora have offered him the
Presidentship of that interesting State. At the same time an urgent
invitation has been sent to the eminent conductor offering him the
throne of the Empire of Percussia. Sir HENRY'S decision is awaitod
with feverish anxiety.</p>
<p>It is stated by the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> that Madame
MELBA, the Australian nightingale, has been chosen to preside over
the Jug-jugo-Slav Republic, while Madame CLARA BUTT has been
unanimously elected Empress of Patagonia.</p>
<p>Sir THOMAS BEECHAM'S selection from among the candidates for the
throne of New Guinea, is regarded as a foregone conclusion. The
famous violinist, Mr. ALBERT SAMMONS, has so far returned no final
answer to the offer of the Crown of Sordinia, but it is believed
that he cannot long remain mute to the touching appeal of the
signatories. A favourable answer is also expected from Mlle. Jelly
Aranyi, who has been nominated Queen of Guava.</p>
<p>On the other hand Sir EDWARD ELGAR, O.M., has steadfastly
declined the Tsardom of Bulgaria, even though it was proposed to
change the name of the country to Elgaria.</p>

<h2>PARLIAMENTARY CASUALTIES.</h2>
<p>Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;I am told that Mr. ASQUITH considers that
this has been a most unsatisfactory election. So do I. As you know,
the principal function of the House of Commons nowadays is to
provide amusing "copy" for the late editions of the evening papers
and to give the "sketch"-writers a chance of exercising their
pretty wits. As Mr. SPENCER LEIGH HUGHES once remarked in an
after-dinner speech to Mr. BALFOUR, "You, Sir, are our raw
material."</p>
<p>Now, what I complain of is that on the present occasion the
voters have entirely disregarded the needs of the journeymen of the
Press, and have ruthlessly deprived them of the greater part of
their raw material. Mr. HUGHES himself, I am glad to see, has been
spared, but he fortunately had not to undergo the hazards of a
contest. I tremble to think what his fate might have been if at the
last moment some stodgy statesman had been nominated to oppose
him.</p>
<p>Against humour, conscious or unconscious, the voters seem to
have solidly set their faces. It was bad enough that Mr. JOE
KING&mdash;who has probably helped to provide more deserving
journalists with a living than any other legislator who ever
lived&mdash;should have declined the contest. Question-time without
Mr. KING and his unerring nose for mare's-nests will be like
<i>Alice</i> without <i>The Mad Hatter</i>. It was bad, too, that
Sir HEDWORTH MEUX should have decided to interrupt the flow of that
eloquence which we were forbidden to call "breezy," and that Major
"Boadicea" HUNT, Mr. JOHN BURNS, Mr. TIM HEALY, and Mr. SWIFT
MACNEILL should have withdrawn from a scene in which they had
provided so much profitable entertainment for the gods in the Press
Gallery.</p>
<p>These losses made it all the more incumbent upon the electors to
see that the House should retain as much as possible of the remnant
of its comic relief. But what do we find? Why, that practically
every one of the gentlemen who made the journalist's life worth
living in the last Parliament has been cruelly turned down.</p>
<p>For much of this grief the Sinn Feiners are responsible. They
have easily accomplished what a few years ago six stalwart British
constables could scarcely do and have removed the gigantic Mr.
FLAVIN from his emerald bench. With him have gone nearly all his
comrades; and the once-powerful Nationalist party, which for nearly
forty years has been such an unfailing source of sparkling
paragraphs, is reduced to the number immortalised by WORDSWORTH'S
little maid.</p>
<p>Almost more distressing than the loss of individuals is the
breaking up of Parliamentary partnerships. What is the use of Mr.
HOUSTON being returned if he has no longer Sir LEO CHIOZZA MONEY to
heckle? Captain PRETYMAN-NEWMAN will doubtless continue to ask
questions about the shocking condition of his native country, but
without Mr. REDDY'S squeaking <i>obbligato</i>, "Why isn't the
honourable and gallant Member out at the Front?" they will lose
half their savour. He will be as dull as Io without her gad-fly.
Mr. "Boanerges" STANTON is happily still with us, but with no
pacifists to bellow at I fear that his vocal chords will
atrophy.</p>
<p>Then the famous Young Scots Trio, which has given us so many
attractive "turns," has been violently dissolved. Mr. PRINGLE,
whose ample supply of vitriolic invective was always at the service
of the PRIME MINISTER, has been left by an ungrateful constituency
at the bottom of the poll, and Mr. WATT has shared his fate. It is
true that Mr. HOGGE managed to save his bacon, but without the
support of <i>Harlequin</i> and <i>Pantaloon</i> I fear his
clowning will fail to draw.</p>
<p>With so many of the old puppets gone I feel very lonely, and can
only try to comfort myself with the hope that the new Parliament
may provide some adequate substitutes. After all, so vast a machine
must contain a few cranks.</p>
<p>Meantime I remain, Sir, with the highest respect,</p>
<p>YOUR PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT.</p>

<h2>THE BOOM IN ARCHITECTURE.</h2>
<p>Since that far-away period before the War, my architectural
nerve has become sadly debilitated; so when a card (bearing the
name of Carruthers) was brought to me the other morning I felt
quite unmanned.</p>
<p>"Some potential client," I observed inwardly, "who has heard of
the removal of the five-hundred pound limit and has bearded me
before I have had time to get the hang of T-square and compasses
again."</p>
<p>I liked the appearance of Mr. Carruthers, and his greeting had a
slight ring of flattery in it that was very soothing.</p>
<p>"You are Mr. Bellamy, the architect?" he said.</p>
<p>"I am," I replied; "at least I was before the War."</p>
<p>"And have a large practice?" he resumed.</p>
<p>"I certainly had a large practice formerly," I said. "With my
methods and experience one ought to acquire an extensive
<i>clientele</i>. I have been an architect, my dear sir, man and
boy for over forty years, and have always followed the
architectural fashions. In the late seventies, when little columns
of Aberdeen granite were the rage&mdash;you know the stuff, tastes
like marble and looks like brawn&mdash;I went in for them hot and
strong, and every building I touched turned to potted meat. Then
SHAW came along&mdash;BERNARD, was it? no, NORMAN&mdash;with his
red brick and gables, and I got so keen that I moved to Bedford
Park to catch the full flavour of it.</p>
<p>"Next, the Ingle-nooker's found in me a willing disciple. I
designed rows of houses, all roofs and no chimneys, or all chimneys
and no roofs, it didn't <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id=
"page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> matter which so long as there was an
ingle-nook with a motto over it. Why, after a time I got so expert
that I simply designed an ingle-nook and the rest seemed to grow by
itself.</p>
<p>"Just as the War started I had broken out in another place and
was getting into my Italian loggia-pergola-and-sunk-garden stride,
and then came the five-hundred pound limit and busted the whole
show. In fact, when you called I was wondering whether to chuck the
business and go in for writing cinema plays."</p>
<p>"When I want a really fashionable house built for me," said
Carruthers, "I shall certainly come to you."</p>
<p>"Ah," I said, "you have come to see me then on behalf of a
friend?"</p>
<p>"On behalf," he said, "of several friends."</p>
<p>My chest swelled visibly. "This man," I said to myself, while
reaching for my Corona Coronas, "is planning a garden city, or at
least a group of houses on the communal plan."</p>
<p>"The fact is," said Carruthers, clearing his throat, "I am a
scout-master, and my troop are collecting wastepaper, and I expect
you have any amount of old plans and things that you&mdash;"</p>

<h2>THE ARMY OF ENTERTAINMENT, LTD.</h2>
<p>As a mere soldier threatened with unemployment owing to the
sudden outbreak of peace, I offer to any enterprising
company-promoter an idea which should provide him with an immense
fortune and myself with a congenial means of livelihood.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that, with the consent of Lord NORTHCLIFFE and
the Allies, a slice of the old Front should be kept up <i>in statu
quo</i>, and a representative assortment of troops retained to hold
it on what was our side, and to carry on the War as it was in the
good old days of '15, when we thought our life's work was bespoken
and soldiers with boy babies raised the question of making acting
rank hereditary. No enemy would be employed, experiment having
proved that the existence of an enemy detracts from the enjoyment
of modern war.</p>
<p>The little army, commanded by a General, himself an
employ&eacute; of the Army of Entertainment Co., Ltd., would
conduct operations for demonstration purposes. Visitors would be
charged admission to the Company's zone, and pay extra for any
particular stunt show arranged for their benefit.</p>
<p>It would be necessary to acquire a strip of country running
right back to the coast, if realism should be the aim of the
directors, otherwise it would be impossible, to show an A.M.L.O. in
action, or some interesting types of Headquarters, or laundry
Colonels winning the D.S.O.</p>
<p>I have in mind a highly entertaining General who might be
willing to accept the position of G.O.C. for the Company&mdash;one
of those desperate old gentlemen whose joy was to stalk about busy
areas and strafe the domestic and sanitary arrangements of
batteries and battalions. He is of picturesque appearance and would
afford the best comic relief. This General would be attended by the
usual assistants, traditionally housed, clothed and fed, but, the
division being run as a commercial venture, it would be a matter
for consideration by the directors whether these young gentlemen
should receive a salary or pay a fee.</p>
<p>Some visitors might well be so delighted with soldiering, free
from the annoyance of enemy action, that they would wish to make a
long stay and experience all its variations, beginning perhaps with
the P.B.I, (or Pretty Busy Infantry) in a mud-hole in the front
line, and passing through all the stages of the normal military
career till they arrived at the Divisional Chateau. Should anyone
desire to survey life from the altitude of an R.T.O. (Railway
Transport, not Really Tantalising Officer, as supposed by some) it
might be arranged for him, in the interests of realism, to
improvise information as to trains for the benefit of other
visitors.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg
29]</span>
<p>Appropriate rations would be included, in the entrance money,
while there might be canteens for the sale of such extras as
bootlaces and penholders. Visitors would not be allowed to bring
money into the area, but would be given the usual books of cash
withdrawal forms, entitling them to obtain small sums from the
field cashier&mdash;if they could find him. As a field cashier of
experience would be employed and possibly act in collusion with the
R.T.O., these sums of money might be regarded as prizes, and would
create a pleasant excitement without amounting to any great expense
for the Company.</p>
<p>Those willing to pay high prices would have arranged for them
such displays as "normal artillery activity," pukka strafes, S.O.S.
bombardments or barrages chaperoning infantry advances, while
balloons might be set on fire, dumps blown up, or leave cancelled
at special rates. There might also be an assortment of inexpensive
and amusing side-shows, such as a Second-in-command trying to check
a monthly return of dripping, or a conscientious gunner calculating
the correct corrector corrections.</p>
<p>Should an application be received from any person anxious to
experience war from the "Receipts" end he would be granted free
entry to the area on the far side of the line, protected
grand-stands being erected, from which, on suitable payment,
spectators could study his deportment. A short stay in the "enemy's
area" during a strafe might be recommended for politicians and
arranged by their constituents.</p>
<p>Space forbids further detail. It remains only for a Company to
be formed&mdash;affiliated perhaps to the Bureau of
Information&mdash;a detailed prospectus issued and applications
invited for posts under the Army of Entertainment, Ltd.</p>
<p>I shall myself be willing to serve the Company in the capacity
of a Town Major on condition that a suitable town is provided.</p>

<h2>WISE WORDS FOR BIRDS.</h2>
<p>Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;While lately turning over some old family
papers I came across a number of maxims in rhyme which seem to me
to be worthy of publication at a time devoted to good cheer. The
form appears to be the same as that expressed in the familiar
couplets on the woodcock and the partridge; but these variations on
an old theme have at least the merit of freshness and
originality.</p>
<p>I begin in order of magnitude with the ostrich:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If an ostrich had but a woodcock's thigh</p>
<p>It would only be some three feet high.</p>
<p>If a woodcock had but an ostrich's jaw</p>
<p>It would have to be carved with a circular saw."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The foregoing lines clearly enforce the important lesson of
contentment with the existing order. This moral is perhaps less
implicit in the lines on the peacock:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If a peacock had but the nightingale's trill</p>
<p>It would make all prima donnas feel ill.</p>
<p>If the nightingale had but the peacock's tail</p>
<p>It would merit a headline in the <i>Mail</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Contentment again is the keynote of the couplets on the
owl:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If an owl would enter the nuthatch's nest</p>
<p>Its figure would have to be much compressed.</p>
<p>If the nuthatch had but the face of an owl</p>
<p>It would be a most unpopular fowl."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A slightly different formula is to be noted in the lines on the
snipe, but the spirit is substantially the same:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If a snipe were the size of a threepenny bit</p>
<p>It would be a great deal harder to hit.</p>
<p>But if it grew to the size of an emu</p>
<p>It wouldn't be better to eat than seamew."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly I may quote the only couplet in which beasts as well as
birds are subjected to this searching analysis. I think you will
admit that it is the most sagacious and impressive of them
all:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If a pig had wings and the legs of a stork</p>
<p>It would damage the quality of its pork,"</p>

<h2>REPORTS.</h2>
<p>The other day I was looking through some school reports.
Holidays always bring them forth. You know the kind of thing:
History&mdash;Is most diligent but needs concentration;
Music&mdash;Lacks purposefulness, does not practise sufficiently;
Mathematics&mdash;Weak; General Conduct&mdash;Might be better;
Conversational French&mdash;<i>Sera plus facile avec plus de
confiance</i>; Theology&mdash;A sad falling off; and so on; and it
occurred to me that it might not be a bad thing if the report
system, instead of stopping with our school-days, pursued us
through life. The periodical perusal of a report, drawn up with as
much authority as a scholastic staff possesses, might have very
beneficial results.</p>
<p>My own early ones no longer exist; but it would be a very
searching test of our educational system to study these reports
thirty-five years after and subject them to an honest commentary.
How little that one learned then has persisted, has survived the
probation of time and necessity. At the age of fifteen I knew the
principal rivers of South America ("Geography&mdash;Has made great
progress"); to-day at fifty I have no recollection of any, nor any
desire to have it. Instead I can order dinner. Gastronomy for
geography; new lamps for old! In any report drawn up now there
would be a totally different series of subjects. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Business Method Might be better.</i></p>
<p><i>Punctuality Tries his best.</i></p>
<p><i>Patriotism Good.</i></p>
<p><i>Veracity Moderate.</i></p>
<p><i>Financial Soundness Very variable.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a means of constructive criticism the report system might be
useful in Parliament. The Speaker, as headmaster, should be
entrusted with the task of preparing the documents. I can see some
such results as the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>THE PRIME MINISTER.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Logic Weak.</i></p>
<p><i>Opportunism Strong.</i></p>
<p><i>Golf Shows little improvement.</i></p>
<p><i>Belligerence Very good.</i></p>
<p><i>Tonsorial Artistry Far from satisfactory. Should give
it</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>more attention.</i></p>
<p><i>Oratory Fluent and powerful, but must guard</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>against impulse. Too fond in perorations</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>of drawing metaphors from Welsh</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>physical geography.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>MR. BONAR LAW.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Mediation Admirable, but must not be overworked.</i></p>
<p><i>Oratory Fair. Has tendency to unnecessary candour.</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>Does not sufficiently employ periphrasis.</i></p>
<p><i>Fidelity Beyond praise.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Oratory Effective, if given enough time to prepare.</i></p>
<p><i>Modesty Room for improvement.</i></p>
<p><i>Polarity Weak.</i></p>
<p><i>Ambition An honest worker.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lastly, let us take the report sheet of one not wholly absent
from the public eye, whom I will designate merely by the initials
W.W.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Pride Far less than he had two or three years ago.</i></p>
<p><i>Facial beauty More than adequate.</i></p>
<p><i>Subrisivity Phenomenal.</i></p>
<p><i>Oratory Admirable, but too fond of telling the</i></p>
<p class="i10"><i>same story.</i></p>
<p><i>Popularity Could not be greater.</i></p>

<h2>HAIR-CUTTING AND DENTISTRY.</h2>
<p>I am going to get my hair cut. But I must first mention the
matter to my wife.</p>
<p>Why do I do this? It is not because I am a coward, for there are
few men who are in reality braver than I am. I carried my firstborn
in my arms round the drawing-room when she was a week old, and I
have done other things equally brave, the enumeration of which I
spare you. But I could no more think of getting my hair cut without
previously informing my wife than I could think of wearing a top
hat in the Strand.</p>
<p>I know what will happen when I have told my wife. She will look
up and say, "That's right; you always do it."</p>
<p>And I shall say, "What do I always do?"</p>
<p>And she will answer, "You always get yourself cropped like a
convict just when your hair was beginning to look nice."</p>
<p>And I shall say, "I can't help that; it's got to be done." And
then I shall go and get it done.</p>
<p>But I wonder if my wife is right after all. There used to be a
nice wave in my front hair, a wave into which you could lay two
fingers. Is that there still? No, it's gone. In fact there is not
sufficient front hair to make a wave with. It's odd how gradually
these things happen. I could have sworn that I had that wave, and
there is a photograph of me in the drawing-room with a
fully-developed tidal bore; and I went on brushing my front hair
and combing it and thinking of it all the time as constituting a
wave, and lo it had vanished, leaving me under the impression that
it was still there and accountable for the pleasing effect I
produced in general society.</p>
<p>But if it wasn't the wave that produced this effect, what could
it have been? My voice? Perhaps. My moustache? I doubt it. My
teeth? Possibly. See advertisements of tooth powders <i>passim</i>.
You know how it's done, in the before and after style. Before you
use Dentoline you apparently do not possess so much as a front
tooth. After you have used it once you are in possession of
thirty-two regular and brilliant white teeth, and it seems plain
that no dentist will ever make his fortune out of your mouth. All
this, however, has nothing to do with getting my hair cut. But it
brings me to an analogous consideration. When I tell my wife I am
going to get my teeth attended to, does she try to restrain me from
the fatal deed? Not she. She urges me to it, and leaves me no
loophole for escape. She indulges in reminiscences of herself and
the children defying pain in the dentist's chair, and heartens me
with the statement that the instrument she likes best is the one
that goes <i>berr-r-r-r</i> and makes you jump.</p>
<p>Let me now resume my commentary on hair-cutting. I wonder if I
am sufficiently chatty with my hair-cutter. Most men talk to their
hair-cutter all the time. They discuss politics and revolutions and
Britain's unconquerable might, while I, having made a blundering
start with the weather, am brought up with a round turn on the
Bolsheviks and President WILSON'S manner of dealing with the
situation. I cannot lay bare my inmost thoughts about the League of
Nations while someone is running a miniature mowing-machine along
the back of my neck ...</p>
<p>At this moment my wife entered the room.</p>
<p>"My dear," I said, "I am going to get my hair cut."</p>
<p>She gave me one mind-piercing look and said, "It's time you did.
I've been noticing it for the last day or two."</p>
<p>Nothing, you see, about convicts. Isn't that like a woman, never
to say the thing you expect her to say? It's taken all the pleasure
out of my visit to the barber. In fact I don't think I shall go at
all.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerics.)</i></h4>
<p><i>Secrets of the Bosphorus</i> (HUTCHINSON) is one of the
happily large number of books to which time and tardy-footed
justice have now added an unwritten chapter that makes amends for
all. But for the glories of the last few months I think I could
hardly have borne to read many of these "revelations" of Mr. HENRY
MORGENTHAU, sometime American Ambassador to Turkey. They make
strange and often tragic reading. One of them is already famous:
the disclosure of the narrow margin by which the attack of the
Allied fleets upon the Dardanelles came short of victory. For that,
with all its ghastly sequence of misadventure, no happy end can
quite compensate. But one may read more pleasantly now of the
Prussian Baron WANGENHEIM, sitting the day long on a bench before
his official residence to exult publicly in what looked like the
triumphal march to Paris. Mr. MORGENTHAU has many other matters of
interest in his note-book, a large part of which is occupied by the
story, almost incredible even in an age of horrors, of the planned
slaughter by the Turkish rulers, with Germany as accessory before
and after the act, of "at least 600,000 and perhaps as many as
1,000,000" Armenians. He rightly calls this murder of a nation
probably the blackest deed in all the foul record of the war, in
which (at the precise moment of its execution) the same people who
now protest against the severity of our terms were taking a
horrible and ruthless joy. The reminder is apt.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Much of the pleasure that I have just enjoyed over Mr. ARTHUR
SYMONS' essays of travel in <i>Cities and Sea Coasts and
Islands</i> (COLLINS) belongs to the wistful joy of recollection:
remembered loveliness in the beautiful places of which he writes so
vividly, remembered peace of the quiet unpreoccupied days in which
they were written. The book is made up of three groups, studies of
Spain, of London and of certain coasts, chiefly Cornish. For
several reasons I found the last interested me most. There is
entertainment in watching Mr. SYMONS, so essentially a dweller in
cities, discovering the open air like an explorer. You know already
his mastery of delicate and sensitive words; many of these pages
catch with exquisite skill the subtle charm of the country between
land and wave, as it would present itself to a receptive summer
visitor rather than the returned native. Mr. SYMONS' similes are
essentially urban; the sea (to take an example at random) has for
him "something of the colour of absinthe." In fine, though he can
and does get into his pages much of the exhilaration of a tramp
over heathery cliffs "smelling of honey and sea wind," one retains
throughout a not unpleasing consciousness of Paddington. I have
left myself too little space to deal adequately with other papers,
among which I was delighted to find again that called "Dieppe
1895," long remembered from <i>The Savoy</i> <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> (though
here, of course, lacking the interpretation of the BEARDSLEY
drawings). Certainly a book to read at leisure and to keep "for
further reference," perhaps in a future when travel studies may
again become of more than merely sentimental interest.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sir ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, on the strength of <i>Danger! and Other
Stories</i> (MURRAY), may claim a place among the prophets who were
not accepted by their own country. "Danger!"&mdash;written some
eighteen months before the outbreak of war&mdash;foretells the
horrors of the unrestricted use of the submarine. In those days Sir
ARTHUR could get no one to listen to him, because "in some
unfortunate way subjects of national welfare are in this country
continually subordinated to party politics." Possibly now that we
have been taught by painful experience all we want to know about
U-boat warfare, excitement in this tale is rather to seek, but it
remains a most successful prophecy. In the last story of the book
we have the author in his very worst form. "Three of Them" is a
study of children, and the only excuse I can find for it is that it
must be intended as a sop to the sentimentalists. Of the others my
first vote goes to "The Surgeon of Gaster Fell," and my second to
"The Prisoner's' Defence;" but if you are susceptible to Sir
ARTHUR'S sense of fun I can also recommend "The Fall of Lord
Barrymore" and "One Crowded Hour." Not a great collection, but just
good enough.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. ROMER WILSON has devoted the nearly three hundred pages of
his <i>Martin Schuler</i> (METHUEN) to describing what it feels
like to be a genius, and, speaking from a very limited knowledge of
this class, I should say that he had mapped the mind of a genius of
a certain sort very well. His estimate of the creative artist's
anguish of emptiness rings true, and will, perhaps surprise the
people who think that his lot, like a policeman's, is a very happy
one. His <i>Martin</i>, who struck me as a very unpleasant young
man, was a composer who meant to achieve immortality, but turned
down the broad way of musical comedy and acquired money instead.
Just in time he repented and wrote a grand opera, and then Mr.
WILSON cut short his career in a fashion that seemed to me
regrettably hackneyed, which was the only reason why I shared the
other characters' sorrow. Why so many people, all rather nasty
people too, came to devote themselves to <i>Martin</i> I could not
discover, although I had the publisher's word for it that he was
"attractive"; but perhaps his genius accounted for it. Probably it
is my duty to declare here that <i>Martin</i> and his friends were
almost all made in Germany before the War, but as they are
exceptionally disagreeable and quite unlikely to inspire anyone
with an unjust tenderness for their nation I have no hesitation in
recommending the book as a clever study of temperament and a just
picture of a part of the German musical world as it was when one
last knew anything about it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is all a matter of taste, of course, but personally I don't
envy Mr. J.G. LEGGE his self-imposed task of convicting the Hun out
of his own mouth of&mdash;well, of being a Hun. Germans they were
and Germans they remain, and the author goes to great lengths, even
to the length of 572 pages, to show that their peculiar qualities
date back at least as far as 1813. His <i>Rhyme and Revolution in
Germany</i> (CONSTABLE) is not so much a history of the scrambling
undignified revolutionary movements culminating in the year 1848,
as a collection of contemporary comment thereon, in prose and
verse. The prose is generally bad; the verse is generally very bad;
and one turns with relief to the author's connecting links, wishing
only at times that he would not worry about proving his point quite
so thoroughly. The bombast and the bullying, the self-pity and the
cruelty, and, most of all, the instinctive claim, typical of
Germany to-day, to prescribe one law for themselves but something
quite different for the rest of the world, run through all these
quotations, even the earliest. But the particular value of this
book at the moment is its reminder that twice already has the House
of Hohenzollern humbly pledged its All-Highest word to give
constitutional government, only to resume "divine right" at the
earliest convenient moment. Ruling Germany, and as much else as
possible, with a view to the glorification of one's personal family
and one's personal God, must be an exhausting labour, and once
again the head of the dynasty is afforded an opportunity for a
respite. It is a temptation which one feels sure he will find
himself strong enough to resist if occasion serves. History and Mr.
LEGGE suggest that he will be willing&mdash;even
enthusiastic&mdash;to grovel in the dust to assist that
occasion.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. SPENCER LEIGH HUGHES is a brilliant and distinguished member
of the great brotherhood of the Press; he is also a Member of
Parliament and has devoted himself heart and soul to the
propagation of his principles on the platform. He has therefore,
save in respect of great age (he is barely sixty), every right to
compile and publish a book with the title, <i>Press, Platform and
Parliament</i> (NISBET). It is one of the most genuinely
good-tempered books I have ever read; but that was to be expected
from the author of the column signed "<i>Sub Rosa</i>," who had in
this course of desultory writing made innumerable friends and never
lost one; and, more pleasing sport than that, had brought two
people together through a matrimonial agency conducted by W.T.
STEAD, and had met the pair many years after, to find that they
were perfectly and unexpectedly happy.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
